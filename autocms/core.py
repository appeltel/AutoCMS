    A JobRecord may store arbitrarily many properties about a completed job

    exists in the output log.

    guaranteed to exist (with the specified type if listed):

        seq - the integer passed to the job execution script.
        jobid - the scheduler job id or None if submission failed
        submit_time (int): timestamp of submission time.
        submit_status (int): exit code of the submission command.
        start_time (int): timestamp of when the job started running
                          or zero if the job is not yet completed.
        end_time (int): timestamp of when the job completed
                        or zero if the job is not yet completed.
        node: hostname of the worker node that runs the job or None.
        logfile: Expected file containing standard output of the job reported
                 through the scheduler. Note that due to scheduler errors
                 this file may never actually exist.
        completed (boolean): completion status of the job.
        exit_code (int): exit code returned by the job script
        exit_string: string describing the reason for job failure.
